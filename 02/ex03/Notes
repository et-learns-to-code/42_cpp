Understanding Barycentric Coordinates in an Intuitive Way

barycentric: relating to the centre of gravity

Imagine you have a triangle with three points:

A, B, and C
You also have a test point P somewhere in the plane.
Now, you want to answer:
"Is P inside the triangle?"

Instead of using absolute positions (like x and y coordinates), we use relative positions called barycentric coordinates.

Key Idea: Expressing P as a Weighted Combination of A, B, and C
Think of P as being "made up of" parts of A, B, and C in some proportion:

P=αA+βB+γC
α tells us how much of A is in P
β tells us how much of B is in P
γ tells us how much of C is in P
If all these weights are between 0 and 1, then P is inside the triangle.
If any weight is negative or greater than 1, P is outside.

Why This Works Intuitively
Think of the weights α,β,γ like percentages:

If α=1, then P is exactly at A.
If β=1, then P is exactly at B.
If γ=1, then P is exactly at C.
If α=β=γ= 1/3, then P is exactly in the center of the triangle.
By adjusting these values, you can move P anywhere in or around the triangle.

Mathematical Formula to Compute α, β, γ
To calculate these weights, we use determinants (or cross-products):

α= area of triangle PBC / area of triangle ABC

β= area of triangle PCA / area of triangle ABC

γ= area of triangle PAB / area of triangle ABC

Each weight is the ratio of a sub-triangle’s area to the total area.

Final Decision: Is P Inside?
Once you calculate α,β,γ, check:
- If all are between 0 and 1, P is inside. ✅
- If any is negative or greater than 1, P is outside. ❌

Why Barycentric Coordinates Are Useful
Fast Computation – No need for expensive square roots or trigonometry.
Works for Any Triangle Shape – Even if it's not equilateral or right-angled.
Stable for Floating-Point Math – Unlike some other geometric tests.
Summary
A point P is inside a triangle if it can be written as a weighted sum of A, B, and C.
The weights α,β,γ are found using area ratios.
If all weights are between 0 and 1, P is inside the triangle.
